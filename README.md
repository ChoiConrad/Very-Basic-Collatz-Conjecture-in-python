# Collatz Conjecture
 Basic programming of the collatz conjecture in python

# Background story
I was eating a slice of cake and stumbled upon a youtube short called "The Most Dangerous Problem in Math" by Vertiasium https://youtu.be/8fNFd2Xswjs?si=RE_CKlDKsbkpamy5 it essentially talks about the Collatz Conjecture.
## TLDR
Take any number, if it is even, divide by 2. If its odd, multiply the number by 3 and add 1. Do this on loop until it will reach a loop of 4->2->1 

# Why?
When listening to the video I decided to make it into a python script using linked lists. 

# Roadmap?
Nope, not planning on working on this anymore.
